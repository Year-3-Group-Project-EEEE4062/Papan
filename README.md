# Project Name

## Description
This project aims to design and development of an autonomus boat is proposed to perform subsurface temperature measurement in lakes and rivers.

## Repositories

### 1. [Main System](https://github.com/Year-3-Group-Project-EEEE4062/Papan/tree/main/Complete)
This repository contains the complete system for the project. It includes [list key components or functionalities].

### 2. [Fuzzy Logic Controller Design](link-to-repo)
This repository holds the code for the fuzzy logic controller designed for the project. It help the boat to navigate for autonomous mode.

### 3. [Object Avoidance Algorithm](link-to-repo)
Here you can find the implementation of the object avoidance algorithm for the project. This algorithm ensures that the boat avoid any obstacle detected.

### 4. [Static Controller](link-to-repo)
The static controller repository contains code for keeping the boat static under certain conditions. It ensures that the boat remain static within the threshold boundary of 1.5m.
